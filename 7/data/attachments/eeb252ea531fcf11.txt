It has a white chest, rosy belly, brown wings which are black edged and a tail that is black and white edged. Its tiny beak and mouse-like, round, black eye sit below a black capped head with a white go faster stripe running down the middle. The yellow top eyelid looks weird. Sadly a small out of focus branch cuts across the image and the birds head. The background is more thin branches, crisscrossing each other, with the occasional green shoot out of focus. Taken in Alicante province, Spain."
